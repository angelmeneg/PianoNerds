                        <p>The video shows Arrau performing the piece in a professional recording studio or concert hall setting. The camera work includes:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>0:00-0:30:</strong> Opening shot of Arrau seated at a grand piano, wearing formal attire (dark suit). The camera shows his profile as he begins the piece with intense concentration.</li>
                            <li><strong>0:30-2:00:</strong> Various angles alternate between close-ups of his hands on the keyboard and wider shots showing his upper body and facial expressions. The lighting is dramatic, with the pianist well-lit against a darker background.</li>
                            <li><strong>2:00-5:00:</strong> As the piece intensifies, the camera captures Arrau's increasing physical engagement with the music. His body movements become more pronounced during dramatic passages, and the camera occasionally pans across the full length of the piano to show the scale of the instrument.</li>
                            <li><strong>5:00-8:00:</strong> During the more lyrical middle section, there are extended close-ups of Arrau's face showing his emotional connection to the music. His expressions change subtly with the character of the music.</li>
                            <li><strong>8:00-11:00:</strong> As the piece builds to its climactic sections, the camera work becomes more dynamic, with quicker cuts between different angles to match the increasing intensity of the music.</li>
                            <li><strong>11:00-14:00:</strong> The final minutes feature a combination of all previous camera angles, culminating in a wide shot as the piece concludes, showing Arrau's slight pause before relaxing his posture as the final notes fade.</li>

                                <strong>0:00-1:30:</strong> The piece begins with ominous, rumbling bass notes and a dark, brooding theme that suggests the turbulent sea. Arrau creates an atmosphere of foreboding with his controlled, weighted touch.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                <strong>1:30-3:45:</strong> The music becomes increasingly agitated with swirling passages that evoke stormy waters. Arrau's playing features dramatic dynamic contrasts, from whisper-quiet moments to thunderous fortissimo sections.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                <strong>3:45-6:00:</strong> A transformation occurs as a more lyrical, tender theme emerges, possibly representing the love between Hero and Leander. Arrau's touch becomes notably more delicate and singing in quality.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                <strong>6:00-8:30:</strong> The music alternates between moments of calm and renewed turbulence. Arrau masterfully balances these contrasting elements, creating a sense of narrative tension.

                                <strong>8:30-11:00:</strong> The piece builds to its most dramatic section with virtuosic passages across the entire keyboard. Arrau's technical prowess is on full display with cascading octaves, rapid scales, and powerful chords.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                <strong>11:00-12:30:</strong> A return to the lyrical theme, now transformed and more intense. Arrau brings out the emotional depth of this section with subtle rubato and tonal shading.
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                <strong>12:30-14:00:</strong> The piece concludes with a final dramatic buildup followed by a series of descending passages that suggest resignation or tragedy. Arrau's performance ends with carefully weighted final chords that slowly fade into silence.

                        <h2>Musical Analysis</h2>
                        <p>Liszt's Ballade No. 2 in B Minor is one of his most significant piano works, combining virtuosic writing with profound emotional expression. Key musical elements include:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Programmatic Structure:</strong> The piece follows a narrative arc believed to be based on the Greek myth of Hero and Leander, with musical sections corresponding to different parts of the story.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thematic Transformation:</strong> Liszt uses his technique of thematic transformation, where the same musical material appears in different guises throughout the piece.</li>
                            <li><strong>Virtuosic Techniques:</strong> The work demands exceptional technical skill, including rapid octaves, complex cross-rhythms, wide leaps, and extreme dynamic contrasts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Harmonic Innovation:</strong> Liszt's forward-looking harmonic language includes unusual progressions and dissonances that were revolutionary for his time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Arrau's interpretation is particularly noted for his architectural approach to the piece's structure, his exceptional control of tone color, and his ability to maintain clarity even in the most technically demanding passages.</p>

                        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                        <p>This recording was made as part of Arrau's acclaimed Liszt album for Deutsche Grammophon. Arrau is known for his meticulous approach to recording, often bringing his own piano to sessions and insisting on perfect acoustic conditions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Liszt composed his Ballade No. 2 in B Minor in 1853 during his Weimar period, when he was focusing on more substantial, structurally complex compositions. The piece represents Liszt's mature style, combining his earlier virtuosic writing with a more profound musical expression and narrative approach.</p>
                        
                        <p>The connection to the Hero and Leander myth gives the piece its dramatic arc: Leander would swim across the Hellespont each night to visit his beloved Hero, guided by a lamp she would light. One stormy night, the winds extinguished the lamp, and Leander drowned. Upon finding his body, Hero threw herself into the sea to join him in death.</p>
