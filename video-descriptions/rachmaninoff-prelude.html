                        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                        <p>This recording was made in the mid-20th century and represents the Russian piano tradition. Vladimir Sofronitsky was known for his profound interpretations of Romantic repertoire, particularly works by Russian composers. His approach to Rachmaninoff's music emphasizes the lyrical qualities while maintaining the structural integrity of the composition.</p>
                        
                        <p>Rachmaninoff composed his Prelude in G Major as part of his Opus 32 set of preludes in 1910. This set completed his cycle of 24 preludes in all major and minor keys, following the tradition established by composers like Chopin and Bach. The G Major prelude stands out for its serene, contemplative character amid some of the more dramatic preludes in the set.</p>
